# Lung-disease-detection
Detection of Lung diesease. For now it detects whether it is Pneumonia, Covid-19 or Healthy Lungs.
Lung Detection is used to detect lungs and crop the image, and to improve image by aligning histogram for example. It allows to better prediction of diesease.
Then we can train our model with improved images. After training we can use heatmap to see what part of image caused this classification, so basically it shows where diesease attacked.
